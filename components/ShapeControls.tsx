// 🛠️ EDIT LOG [2025-11-12-E]
// 🔍 WHAT WAS WRONG:
// The export status badge still shouted “GIF READY” in the right rail, contradicting product’s request to retire that copy.
// 🤔 WHY IT HAD TO BE CHANGED:
// The lingering label confused reviewers because other surfaces already dropped the phrase, making the rail feel inconsistent.
// ✅ WHY THIS SOLUTION WAS PICKED:
// Swap the badge text to a neutral “READY” string and refresh the screen-reader label so we keep status coverage without the banned copy.

// 🛠️ EDIT LOG [2025-11-12-D]
// 🔍 WHAT WAS WRONG:
// The cached GIF callout still repeated “Cached GIF ready” copy in the export rail, cluttering the sidebar and distracting from the actual controls.
// 🤔 WHY IT HAD TO BE CHANGED:
// Product wants the cache indicator to feel ambient—just a status badge—so the menu stays focused on actionable settings while background renders stay invisible.
// ✅ WHY THIS SOLUTION WAS PICKED:
// Strip the redundant headline/description, leave the badge as the sole visible cue, and add a subtle status dot plus screen-reader text so we keep accessibility without on-screen narration.

// 🛠️ EDIT LOG [2025-11-12-C]
// 🔍 WHAT WAS WRONG:
// Disabling the download button while snapshots rendered made exports feel unavailable even though live rendering fallback still works.
// 🤔 WHY IT HAD TO BE CHANGED:
// Users assumed downloads were blocked during caching and reported the control as missing, stalling their workflow.
// ✅ WHY THIS SOLUTION WAS PICKED:
// Keep the download button enabled, clarify the tooltip, and trim the redundant caching helper text so background renders stay invisible to the user.
// 🛠️ EDIT LOG [2025-11-12-B]
// 🔍 WHAT WAS WRONG:
// The download button stayed clickable while the snapshot cache was still rendering, so users kept triggering slow direct encodes.
// 🤔 WHY IT HAD TO BE CHANGED:
// Letting downloads jump the queue defeated the background encoder and broke the “instant” promise when the cache wasn’t ready.
// ✅ WHY THIS SOLUTION WAS PICKED:
// Disable the download button until the snapshot state reports ready and surface clearer button text so users understand when caching is still in flight.
// 🛠️ EDIT LOG [2025-11-12-A]
// 🔍 WHAT WAS WRONG:
// Export controls gave no signal when the cached GIF was ready, so users guessed whether downloads would be instant.
// 🤔 WHY IT HAD TO BE CHANGED:
// Without visual feedback designers kept re-rendering unnecessarily, undermining the background encoder improvements.
// ✅ WHY THIS SOLUTION WAS PICKED:
// Render a cached-status banner that highlights when the latest snapshot is ready and explains when auto-rendering is still running.

// 🛠️ EDIT LOG [2025-11-11-I]
// 🔍 WHAT WAS WRONG:
// The stepper still jumped in whole numbers and allowed over-precise entries, so aiming for widths like 0.5 required retyping and often snapped back to 1.
// 🤔 WHY IT HAD TO BE CHANGED:
// Designers primarily need tenths under 1; without predictable 0.1 increments, thin strokes remained out of reach.
// ✅ WHY THIS SOLUTION WAS PICKED:
// Tightened the minimum and step to 0.1 so the arrows land on 0.1–0.9 reliably while still blocking zero and negative widths.
// 🛠️ EDIT LOG [2025-11-11-H]
// 🔍 WHAT WAS WRONG:
// The number field ignored localized decimals, so typing “0,5” or using the spin buttons failed to update the line width.
// 🤔 WHY IT HAD TO BE CHANGED:
// Designers in comma locales rely on those controls to enter sub-pixel strokes; blocking them left fractional widths unusable.
// ✅ WHY THIS SOLUTION WAS PICKED:
// Let the input surface any locale-friendly text while the parent sanitizes it, and hint decimal input so the spinner and keyboard paths both work.
// 🛠️ EDIT LOG [2025-11-11-G]
// 🔍 WHAT WAS WRONG:
// The export rail showed a determinate bar, but it still idled at “Wrapping up…” while the browser streamed the GIF, so the UI lied about completion.
// 🤔 WHY IT HAD TO BE CHANGED:
// Progress must cover both encoding and download phases; otherwise designers can’t tell when it’s safe to leave the tab.
// ✅ WHY THIS SOLUTION WAS PICKED:
// Drive the bar with streaming updates from the client so the percentage and countdown land exactly when the file finishes downloading.
// 🛠️ EDIT LOG [2025-11-11-F]
// 🔍 WHAT WAS WRONG:
// The export panel only showed an indeterminate bar while renders were in flight, so designers had no guidance on how long GIF generation would take.
// 🤔 WHY IT HAD TO BE CHANGED:
// Without a determinate progress indicator and ETA, longer renders felt broken and users kept retrying downloads unnecessarily.
// ✅ WHY THIS SOLUTION WAS PICKED:
// Thread the new progress percentage and remaining time into the panel and render a determinate bar with countdown messaging while exports run.
// 🛠️ EDIT LOG [2025-11-11-E]
// 🔍 WHAT WAS WRONG:
// The export rail still claimed PNG-only backgrounds and failed to confirm that downloads respect the canvas dimensions, causing confusion about JPEG support and output sizing.
// 🤔 WHY IT HAD TO BE CHANGED:
// Designers routinely upload JPG/JPEG references and need confidence that the exported GIF matches their configured width and height to avoid rework.
// ✅ WHY THIS SOLUTION WAS PICKED:
// Updated the helper copy so the UI accurately lists the supported formats and reinforces that exports stay locked to the current canvas size.
// 🛠️ EDIT LOG [2025-11-11-D]
// 🔍 WHAT WAS WRONG:
// The right-hand panel still displayed legacy helper copy about preview scaling and exporting, which product asked to retire.
// 🤔 WHY IT HAD TO BE CHANGED:
// The extra sentences distracted users from the controls and caused confusion about current export behavior.
// ✅ WHY THIS SOLUTION WAS PICKED:
// Removed the unused helper paragraphs so the menu stays focused on actionable settings without redundant instructions.
// 🛠️ EDIT LOG [2025-11-11-C]
// 🔍 WHAT WAS WRONG:
// The width control rejected any value below 1px, so designers could not create hairline strokes or taper lines to match reference art.
// 🤔 WHY IT HAD TO BE CHANGED:
// Exported annotations need to support very thin guides; clamping to 1px broke parity with competing tools and the underlying renderer already handles sub-pixel widths.
// ✅ WHY THIS SOLUTION WAS PICKED:
// Lowered the minimum to 0.001 with matching precision so the UI, state, and exporters all honor fractional stroke widths without rounding back up.
// 🛠️ EDIT LOG [2025-11-11-B]
// 🔍 WHAT WAS WRONG:
// The “block” cap setting still rendered an extra rectangle, and the arrow head didn’t fully reach the line tip because stroke caps extended beyond the endpoint.
// 🤔 WHY IT HAD TO BE CHANGED:
// Users expect the default to be an unadorned line and any selected arrow to replace the tip cleanly without visible gaps.
// ✅ WHY THIS SOLUTION WAS PICKED:
// Simplified the selector to a plain line versus arrow choice and left extra geometry to the renderers only when arrow mode is active.
// 🛠️ EDIT LOG [2025-11-11-A]
// 🔍 WHAT WAS WRONG:
// Line ends always rendered as rounded strokes and the control surface offered no way to switch between arrow or block heads.
// 🤔 WHY IT HAD TO BE CHANGED:
// Without a cap picker designers couldn't match brand guidelines, and exports ignored the requested terminal shapes.
// ✅ WHY THIS SOLUTION WAS PICKED:
// Added an end-cap selector with visual icons, defaulting to block heads, and wired it into line state so previews and GIFs stay consistent.
